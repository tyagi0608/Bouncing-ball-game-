# Bouncing-ball-game-
This repository contains three progressively enhanced versions of a simple bouncing ball game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game starts with a basic bouncing ball animation. It evolves into an interactive game where users can click on the ball to earn points, with increasing difficulty in later versions.
Versions
Version 1: Basic Ball Bounce

It's a simple animation where a ball bounces around the screen. The ball changes direction upon hitting the edges of the screen.
Version 2: Random Angle Bounce

It's an enhanced version where the ball bounces off the edges at random angles, making the movement less predictable and more fun.
Version 3: Click to Vanish and Score

The final version adds interactivity: clicking on the ball makes it vanish and reappear at random positions. With each successful click, the score increases and the ballâ€™s speed gradually increases to challenge the player.
