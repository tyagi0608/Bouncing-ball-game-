# Bouncing-ball-game-
This repository contains three progressively enhanced versions of a simple bouncing ball game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game starts with a basic bouncing ball animation and evolves into an interactive game where users can click on the ball to earn points, with increasing difficulty in later versions.
