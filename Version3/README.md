# Version 2: Bouncing Ball Game with Random Angles

## Overview
In Version 2 of the bouncing ball game, we have enhanced the game by introducing random angle changes. Now, every time the ball bounces off the walls, it does so at a randomly generated angle, making the game more dynamic and unpredictable.

## Features
- **Randomized Bounce Angles**: The ball bounces off the edges of the screen at random angles instead of a fixed one, adding variety to the movement.
- **Improved Game Logic**: The ball's path changes unpredictably, making it more challenging for the player to anticipate where the ball will move.

## Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the game.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the game interface and animations.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file containing the logic for ball movement and random angle generation.

## How to Play
1. Watch the ball move and bounce around the screen.
2. The ball will bounce off the walls at random angles, making its movement less predictable.
   
## Future Enhancements
- Adding click interactions and score tracking (Implemented in Version 3).
- Introducing different levels of difficulty based on speed or angle variation.
